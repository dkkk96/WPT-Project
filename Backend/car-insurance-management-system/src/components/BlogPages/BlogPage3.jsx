                Is It Safe to Buy/Renew Car Insurance Online in India?
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-1 blog-para">
                In India, you can easily purchase a car insurance policy or
                renew it online from the insurer’s official website or the
                mobile application. Gone are the days when people were scared to
                transact online. From fearing Internet Banking, they moved
                towards paying from Online Wallets and using other Mobile
                Banking apps. However, the scamsters have also evolved and found
                out new ways of duping people by performing cybercrimes.
                Therefore, one must be vigilant while shopping online. Once
                secure, then you can buy/renew car insurance policies online
                within two minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Before Buying:</strong> Insurance companies selling car
                insurance policies online need to be registered with the
                Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
                The list of such companies is shared on the regulator’s Consumer
                Education Website. You can check if the name of the insurer is
                mentioned in the list or not. If it is, then you can purchase
                the plan from the insurer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>While Buying</strong>Once you are sure that the insurer
                is registered, you can visit their official website and then buy
                or renew the policy from there. You can reach the website by
                directly typing the web address in the browser and searching it
                or by using a search engine (for example, Google) to do so. You
                can also reach the website via the insurer’s official social
                media handles and promotional campaigns.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you reach the online location from where you can purchase
                the plan, verify if it is the insurer’s page and not a duplicate
                one designed to scam you. You can also ask for an official link
                to the page by calling the insurer on their official number. If
                you are buying from the insurer’s app, make sure you have
                downloaded the original app and not a fake one. It’s best to
                download the app from the link given on the insurer’s official
                website.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Post Buying: </strong>Once you have made the payment,
                you must check if you have received the Policy Document or not.
                Post-purchase, the same can be accessed from the website/app or
                by checking the inbox of your email ID that was registered with
                the insurer. On rare occasions, there can be a delay of around
                ten minutes. But if it has been more than ten minutes and you
                haven’t received the Policy Document, then you must contact the
                insurer and follow-up.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Car Insurance is Mandatory in India: </strong>There are strict laws concerning car insurance in India. If you
                own a car, it must be insured before being driven on public
                roads. You do have the option to select the coverage. You can
                either just go for the compulsory Third-party Insurance Plan or
                buy the Comprehensive Cover, which is superior to the previous
                plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Comprehensive Cover includes the Liability Cover and it
                insures your vehicle against damages caused by fire, calamities,
                etc. Such an ‘Own Damage’ cover is not included in the Liability
                Plan. Not following the law can expose you to legal hassles.
                Thus, it is better to buy a Comprehensive Plan as it not only
                takes care of the legal part but also offers help if your
                vehicle is damaged.
